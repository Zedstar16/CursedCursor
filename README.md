# CursedCursor

My first C++ program, it basically allows you to lock the cursor

Lets say you needed to go afk but you like your desktop displaying your pretty wallpaper, but you don't really want anyone using your pc while you are gone. You can simply run this program and hit F7 and the cursor will be locked to a certain position. Hit F7 again and its free to move!

## Controls
- F7 Toggles whether cursor is frozen or not
- F8 Toggles whether program is shown or if its background (shows and hides the window)
- F9 Kills the program
